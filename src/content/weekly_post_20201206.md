The main content of the piece is halfway done, but frankly I ran out of time today before my usual deadline. Posting my Small Stuff section for now and I'll get the main content up tomorrow. The title here is a teaser. 

# Small Stuff

- Slides on [Building technology for society (and all of its complications and messy consequences): case study on automated content moderation](https://social.cs.washington.edu/slides_content_moderation.html) by Dr. Amy Zhang from the new Social Futures Lab at the University of Washington. Really great overview of some issues in online content moderation with jumping-off points to further research.
- [Anatomy of an AI System](https://anatomyof.ai/) art piece slash years-long investigation to put together the most complete picture possible of what goes into the creation of an Amazon Echo. Phenomenal work, staggering in its scale. By Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler (2018).
- A pretty comprehensive list of [ML-based art Colabs](https://github.com/dvschultz/ml-art-colabs). Colabs are cloud-based code notebooks, and this github repo contains a ton of options for getting started in ML-based art generation, including image standards like DeepDream, StyleGAN, and DeOldify, but also text generation with GPT-2, and audio generation!
- Finally, a talk from Larry McEnerney at UChicago on ["The Craft of Writing Effectively."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) This talk is for a very specific purpose, namely how to succeed with academic writing, but particularly in the first half McEnerney brings up a lot of points that were helpful for me personally to hear as someone with an entirely STEM background. He stresses the importance of the reader, the incongruence between why you write a piece and why the reader would be reading it, and points out that "You've learned to write in a system where you're writing to readers who are paid to care about you." Oof.

Until next time,
