Just posting Small Stuff this week - I'm getting ready for Christmas break and also working on a longer piece about what it looks like to release music in 2021 that I might break up into multiple parts. We'll see. For now, enjoy the handful of links below and see you next week!

# Small Stuff

- DeepMind makes a major contribution to the protein folding problem with [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology). Quick summary is that 1-D amino acid sequences "fold" into 3-D proteins where the specific structure largely determines its function, but the nature of that 1-D to 3-D folding has been very difficult to predict computationally. DeepMind modeled each 3-D protein as a graph structure and built an attention-based neural network to predict the graphs of other amino acid sequences.
- This great [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/yael_niv/status/1340163805523918849?s=12) on teaching without grades. Crucially, this doesn't mean teaching without feedback (instead, actually more feedback), but making the teaching process about helping students achieve self-set goals as an iterative process rather than reducing learning to a single-dimensional metric.
- Penny Fractions documenting the accelerating [consolidation of music firms](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/pennyfractions/issues/penny-fractions-a-view-of-record-industry-from-10-000ft-299822).
- Hawaii is [incentivizing remote workers to move there](https://www.moversandshakas.org/), and has its own [slack](https://www.hawaiislack.com/) and [discord](https://www.hawaiidiscord.com) servers. Very cool.

Until next time,
